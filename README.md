## Todo

- Improve logbook:
Show time as well as date
Allow user to set a custom date and time (on new and edit)
Let users search entries and sort by certain fields
Refresh entries when a new one is created (to make it appear straight away)
Improve the entry creation system (activity will have a dropdown, with options like "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Walking", "Cycling" and a custom one)
Improve the data export system (after exporting the file, give the user an option to share it)
Improve the UI for the logbook


- New API:
Use the new spoonacular API (may switch again if it doesn't work out)

- Search
Display some information by default instead of infinitely showing the loading icon, maybe just show a few random foods?
Allow the user to add their own custom foods and save this to a local database

- Add a menu icon in the top left (like this: https://zhijiaprofessionalcontext.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/logotype17.jpg) and have an "About" option which pulls up a popup with a bit of about info
- Settings menu (Clear logbook, clear custom foods, clear exported files, etc)
