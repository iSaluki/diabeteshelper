## Information

This project was setup by [Seth Maurice-Brant](https://github.com/iSaluki) as part of [Saluki Corporation](https://github.com/iSaluki/Saluki-Corporation-Archives/) and is now going GPL to make it free and open for anyone.

Please note that our license only extends to the code written specifically for this project. It does not cover any images or third-party libraries that have been used.

There is an Admob implementation in this project, however it requires you to setup your own API keys. It can also be fairly easily removed, and by default it shouldn't do anything.

The food API also requires an API key from [Edamam](https://www.edamam.com/)'s nutrition analysis API. (or a provider that returns data in a similar way).
