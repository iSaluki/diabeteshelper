## Todo

Strikethrough when complete


**Improve logbook:**
- ~~Show time as well as date 
- Allow user to set a custom date and time (on new and edit)
- Let users search entries and sort by certain fields
- ~~Refresh entries when a new one is created (to make it appear straight away)
- ~~Improve the entry creation system (activity will have a dropdown, with options like "Breakfast", "Lunch", "Dinner", "Walking", "Cycling" and a custom one)
- ~~Improve the data export system (after exporting the file, give the user an option to share it)
- Improve the UI for the logbook

**New API:**
- ~~Use the new spoonacular API (may switch again if it doesn't work out), looking for a good API with lots of food types and meals.

**Search:**
- ~~Display some information by default instead of infinitely showing the loading icon, maybe just show a few random foods?
- Allow the user to add their own custom foods and save this to a local database
- Allow user to "Add to meal" foods after entering a weight and then calculate the total carbs of all items in the meal at once
- Allow user to save a meal preset and then check or edit it at any time

**Add a menu icon in the top left** (like this: https://zhijiaprofessionalcontext.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/logotype17.jpg)
- "About" option which pulls up a popup with a bit of about info
- Settings menu (Clear logbook, clear custom foods, clear exported files, clear meals, reset app (delete all data, gdpr), rate app, contact support, export all data (gdpr) etc)
